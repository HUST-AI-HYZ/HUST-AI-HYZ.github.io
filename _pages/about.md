Hi, I'm Yuanzhe. I am a master student at University of Califronia, San Diego. I have the great honor of being collaborating with [Prof. Yaoqing Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangyaoqingcmu/), Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) and Prof. [Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu). 

I am passionate about model diagnostics and mechanistic interpretability. My  current research is focused on

- understanding the mechanisms, dynamics and generalization of LLMs from the perspective of random matrix theory, high-dimensional statistics and loss landscape;
- leveraging  model/data diagnostics and interpretability insights to improve the transparency, robustness and efficiency  of (scientific) machine learning.
